ESP32 operation algorithm

1- Go to the arduino website and download the arduino IDE 

2- To set up an arduino program to support the ESP32 board
Copy the Stable release link from the following link
https://docs.espressif.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/installing.html
Then follow the steps on the page to download the ESP32 library to your
Arduino

3-optional step To download the examples of ESP32
To facilitate the work and to learn from some ready-made code for ESP32
Find arduino-SPE32 in githup on the right of the page click on the fellowing
link
https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/releases/tag/2.0.3
Then download the zip file and extract the content to your device

To make sure you download the examples on arduino
* From the arduino program, choose Tools, then bord “Arduino Uno”, then choose ESP32 Arduino, then Esp32 Dev Module
* Then go to the main menu choose examples file then you will find the examples downloaded in arduino content

4- Open Arduino from the main menu Examples then 01.Basics then Blink

5- To test if the ESP32 is working properly or not
* If the device is connected to ESP32
  A- Open Compmgmt.msc, then Device Manager, then Ports (COM & LPL) know the name of only the part (COM10)
  B- Then in the Arduino program, from Tools, choose Doit ESP32 DEVKITV1 board and choose Port COM 10
  And finally, run the code to make ESP32 work  
* if the device is not connected
  Copy the Blink code and paste it into the following emulator

6- Make sure the blue light appears on the ESP32

 

When a blue light appears on the 
ESP32, the operation has been successful
